# A5 Dashboard Presentation

> My dashboard is the **Map-Driven Offset Explorer** for analyzing global climate data.
>
> **Target Users:** Environmental analysts and climate researchers who need to explore relationships between emissions, temperature changes, forest carbon, and climate disasters across countries and regions.
>
> **Three Main Tasks:**
> 1. **Task 1: Compare emissions and temperature trends** over time across regions
> 2. **Task 2: Identify countries** with high emissions but low forest carbon offset
> 3. **Task 3: Explore disaster patterns** in relation to emissions levels
>
> Let me demonstrate."

## LIVE DEMO
**[https://wwwlab.cs.univie.ac.at/~alrubayem88/VIS25W/A5/]**

---

### Overview
> "The dashboard has four coordinated views:
> - **A1:** World map showing emissions by color intensity, disaster-prone countries with thicker outlines
> - **A2:** Time series with emissions and temperature anomaly trends
> - **A3:** Scatter plot - emissions versus forest carbon
> - **A4:** Bar chart ranking top 10 disaster-affected countries"

---

### Region Filtering
> "I'll demonstrate regional analysis. Let me filter by **Asia**."
---

### Time Window Brushing 
> "The time series allows temporal analysis."

> "When I brush here, all views recalculate for that period. This reveals how patterns evolved over time. For example, emissions have increased significantly since 2000."

---

### Country Selection & Linking 
> "Views are fully linked. I'll select a country."

> "China is now highlighted across all views. I can see its emissions trend, its position comparing emissions to forest carbon, and its disaster ranking."

> "Shift-click enables multi-selection for comparison."

---

### Scatter Plot Insight
> "The scatter plot reveals an important insight."

> "Countries in the **upper-left** have high forest carbon but low emissions - good carbon offset. Countries in **lower-right** have high emissions but low forest carbon - concerning. Bubble size shows disaster frequency."

---

### Insights
> "The dashboard leads to an interesting finding: Countries with highest disaster counts often have moderate emissions. Climate impact does not always correlate directly with emission levels - smaller nations face disproportionate disaster burdens."

---

> "That concludes my demonstration. Questions?"
